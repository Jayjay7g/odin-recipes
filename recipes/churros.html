    <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
    <p>Churros (Mexican fritters) are very common at fairs. In my border hometown, the line at this stand is always overwhelming. People wait hours in line just to get a taste of these churros. I have run across several recipes but this is the best one by far.</p>
    <p>These churros are crispy on the outside, yet wonderfully tender on the inside. This restaurant-worthy churro recipe will quickly become a staple in your dessert rotation.</p>
    <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 1/2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Combine water, 2 1/2 tablespoons sugar, salt, and 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a small saucepan and place over medium heat. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Stir in flour, stirring until mixture forms a ball.</li>
        <li>Heat oil for frying in a deep fryer or deep pot to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a sturdy pastry bag fitted with a medium star tip. Carefully pipe a few 5- to 6-inch strips of dough into the hot oil; work in batches so you don't crowd the fryer. Cook until golden; use a spider or slotted spoon to transfer churros to paper towels to drain.</li>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon. Roll drained churros in cinnamon and sugar mixture.</li>
    </ol>
